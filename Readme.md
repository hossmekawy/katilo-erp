## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Katilo ERP on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed. [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for isolating dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hossmekawy/katilo-erp.git
   cd katilo-erp
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes:
   ```
   Flask==2.3.3
   Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.3
   Flask-Login==0.6.2
   SQLAlchemy==2.0.20
   Werkzeug==2.3.7
   python-dateutil==2.8.2
   ```

4. **Configure the Application**
   - The app uses SQLite by default (`sqlite:///katilo.db`). No additional setup is needed for the database.
   - Update `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` in `app.py` with a secure key:
     ```python
     app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-very-secure-secret-key'
     ```

5. **Initialize the Database**
   Run the following commands in a Python shell:
   ```python
   from app import app, db
   with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the App**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

   - **Login**: Use `/login` to access the login page.
   - **Register**: Admins can create users via `/api/admin/users`.
